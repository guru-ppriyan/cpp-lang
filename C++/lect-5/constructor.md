A . What is a Constructor in C++?

A constructor is a special function inside a class only in public
that is automatically called when you create an object of that class.


B .Key Features:

Has the same name as the class.

No return type (not even void).

Used to initialize objects and their member variables.


C .Types of Constructors

| Type                          | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Default Constructor**       | Takes no parameters                                          |
| **Parameterized Constructor** | Takes parameters to initialize variables                     |
| **Copy Constructor**          | Initializes an object using another object of the same class |

In class using these three parameters is called constructor Overloading
| **Constructor Overloading**   | Multiple constructors with different parameters |

Constructor Overloading means having more than one constructor in the same class, each with a different parameter list.

It allows you to create objects in different ways depending on how much information you provide when creating the object.
