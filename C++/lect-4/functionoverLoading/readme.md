What is Function Overloading in C++?
Function overloading means having multiple functions with the same name 
but different parameters (type, number, or order).
The compiler decides which function to call based on the arguments passed
 â€” this is compile-time polymorphism.

 Why Use It?
To make your code cleaner and more readable, especially when similar operations are 
performed on different types or numbers of inputs.
