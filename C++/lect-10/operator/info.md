What is Operator Overloading in C++?

Operator Overloading allows you to redefine how operators work for user-defined types (classes/structs).
It makes objects behave like built-in types when using operators 
like +, -, <<, ==, etc.

Syntax: operator is keyword

return_type operator<symbol>(parameters);
